## 1. What is Maven?

Maven is a **build automation** tool used for building, managing, and automating Java projects. Developed by Apache, it simplifies dependency management, compilation, testing, and deployment processes, particularly in Java-based projects. Maven uses an XML-based configuration file called `pom.xml` to define project settings and dependencies.

### **Key Features of Maven:**
- **Dependency Management:** Automatically downloads required libraries for the project.
- **Project Structure Standardization:** Organizes projects in a standard format.
- **Automated Compilation:** Compiles the project (`mvn compile`).
- **Test Execution:** Runs tests using tools like JUnit and TestNG (`mvn test`).
- **Packaging:** Packages the project as a `jar` or `war` file (`mvn package`).
- **Deployment Management:** Deploys applications to remote servers or repositories (`mvn deploy`).
